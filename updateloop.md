Here is a simplified model of how an Elm 0.17 program operates.

```haskell
program init update view subscriptions =
    let
        ( model, cmds ) =
            init
    in
        loop update view subscriptions model cmds


loop update view subscriptions model cmds =
    let
        _ =
            Run cmds |> runtime

        _ =
            Register (subscriptions model) |> runtime

        _ =
            Display (view model) |> runtime

        msg =
            WaitForMessage |> runtime

        ( model', cmds' ) =
            update msg model
    in
        loop update view subscriptions model' cmds'


runtime operation =
    {- execute the operation in the runtime, typically with side-effects -}
    magic
```
