Here is a simplified model of how an Elm 0.17 program operates.

```haskell
program init update view subscriptions =
    let
        ( model, cmds ) =
            init
    in
        loop update view subscriptions model cmds


loop update view subscriptions model cmds =
    let
        _ =
            runtime Run cmds

        _ =
            runtime Register (subscriptions model)

        _ =
            runtime Display (view model)

        msg =
            runtime WaitForMessage ()

        ( model', cmds' ) =
            update msg model
    in
        loop update view subscriptions model' cmds'


runtime operation values =
    {- execute the operation in the runtime, typically with side-effects -}
    magic
```
